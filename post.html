                        <p>Apple is bringing back a blast from the past, Sidekicks! Known to be the phone that “knocked the world on its side,” alongside the upgraded wireless connectivity, this design is back with a twist. Firstly, the new name of the device is very true to all Apple products, iSide. The release date will be December 8th 2022.</p>
                        <p>Apple had bought the design and have worked together with T-Mobile to provide users with the best experience. The last update from T-Mobile being in 2018 with the 4G Data connection and limited text and call. Additionally, on April 6, 2019, T-Mobile made an announcement that Sidekicks no longer have accurate GPS navigation. Time to rescind that statement. iSide's now have unlimited data and an updated GPS location system. With the help of Apple’s IOS technology, location services are now working through the use of, “GPS and Bluetooth (where they're available), along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspots and cellular towers to determine the approximate location of your device,” according to Apple. Of course, your apps will not know your location unless prior permission is given. </p>
